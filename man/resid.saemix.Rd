\usage{

  "iwres", "icwres"), ...)

\method{resid}{SaemixRes}(object, type = c("ires", "wres", "npde", "pd",
  "iwres", "icwres"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an SaemixRes or an SaemixObject object}

\item{type}{string determining which residuals are extracted. Possible values are: "ires" (individual residuals, default), "wres" (weighted population residuals), "npde" (normalised prediction distribution errors), "pd" (prediction discrepancies), "iwres" (individual weighted residuals) and "icwres" (conditional individual weighted residuals). See user guide for details.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to or from other methods}
}
\value{
By default, individual residuals are extracted from the model object
}
\description{
residuals is a generic function which extracts model residuals from objects returned by modelling functions. The  abbreviated form resid is an alias for residuals
